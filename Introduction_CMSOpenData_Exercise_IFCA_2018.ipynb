    "# How to do an Analysis in Particle Physics?\n",
    "\n",
    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "\"Analyzer Package\" is a set of codes keeping all necessary tools needed to carry out a typical analysis in Particle Physics. It's been developed to be used by junior and senior students in the Physics Bachelor, but also it can be used in other academical levels and in science divulgation workshops. It takes in an user guide and a code repository. All data set are open source and can be found at http://opendata.cern.ch/. It is based on the data collected in 2010 at 7 TeV center of mass, by the [CMS](http://cms.web.cern.ch/) detector of the [LHC](http://home.cern/topics/large-hadron-collider) at [CERN](http://home.cern/).  \n",
    "\n",
    "The aim of the exercise is to identify muons in the CMS detector at the LHC using muons from the Z boson decay. We ask the students to scan a mix of various physics events and classify them as Z → μμ. Each student should have some basics about how the detector works, e.g. what kind of 'traces' the different particles leave in the various detectors (tracker, calorimeters, muon chambers). They will need to learn how to select events via their signatures. \n",
    "\n",
    "The exercise will be distributed in three different exercises following sequentially the different steps of the proposed analysis. Each section will be discussed during the classes and always follows 4 different aspects: \n",
    "\n",
    "   * Discussion about the motivation and target of the current section. \n",
    "   * Interactive explanation of the procedures involved to achieved the target\n",
    "   * Practical implementation\n",
    "   * Questions and conclusions\n",
    "\n",
    "The first item is just an introduction to the specific problem treated in the given section including the motivation, the context and the expected results. In the second part an explanation and demonstration of the used procedures are given. Then a practical implementation has to be developed by each student with the help of the monitor. Finally several questions will be asked to the students and discussed together to extract some conclusions.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Work Tools \n",
    "\n",
    "The package software uses interactively the ROOT program (version 6.06/00), dedicated to large data analysis, with a Python interpreter (Python 2.7) due to a Python extension module [PyROOT](https://root.cern.ch/pyroot). \n",
    "\n",
    "All the framework is developed thanks to the CMSOpenData platform exclusively set at IFCA (https://cmsopendata.ifca.es/) that allows to do all exercises through such a simple and intuitive interface as Jupyter notebook is (http://jupyter.org/).  \n",
    "\n",
    "The code has as input a set of plain ROOT Ntuples for data created from the public CMS derived datasets [Rodriguez Marrero, A. (2014). Muons and electrons in PAT candidate format derived primary dataset. CERN Open Data Portal.] \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Analysis Framework\n",
    "\n",
    "It has two sub-packets generating the same results but running in two different ways:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Sequential Analyzer: The analysis is running sequentially in a single node. \n",
    "\n",
    "* PROOF Analyzer: **PROOF **is a ROOT extension enabling interactive analysis of large sets of ROOT files in parallel on clusters of computers or many-core machines (https://root.cern.ch/proof).\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The main code is under [**AnalysisDesigner**](https://cmsopendata.ifca.es/hub/user/~/tree/AnalysisDesigner). This folder contains: \n",
    "\n",
    "* The file **createTTree.py**: it creates the ROOT NTuple (see e.g. http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tuple). This macro is executed by **exeCreateTTree.py**, and creates a root NTuple file: **datafiles/mytree.root**. The NTuples are plain [TTrees](https://root.cern.ch/doc/master/classTTree.html) containing bools, floats, integers and arrays of bools, floats and integers. \n",
    "\n",
    "* If the NTuple root file is already created, the students just have to run the main script: **main.py**.\n",
    "  The code written in **main.py** executes **Analyzer.py** in which the full analysis is done.  \n",
    "  **Analyzer.py** reads the events from the ROOT NTuple, makes a selection of muons candidates based on muon identification and isolation variables defined in **Cuts.py**. Finally, it creates an histograms for each of the variables used to select muon candidates. \n",
    " \n",
    " \n",
    " In a similar way, under the folder [**Analysis_PROOF**](https://cmsopendata.ifca.es/hub/user/~/tree/Analysis_PROOF), the analysis can be performed in PROOF, just running the **main_PROOF.py** script. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "There are some **exercises** to guide the user through the code that will be introduced below. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Task Description \n",
    "\n",
    "Starting with all physical events detected by CMS during 2010 at 7 TeV center of mass energy, the students will be asked to classify the events following a physical selection criteria, deciding which muons could have been produced in a Z->mumu decay.\n",
    "\n",
    "Each student should have some basics about how the detector works, e.g. what kind of 'traces' the different particles leave in the various detectors( tracker, calorimeters, muon chambers) and which are the main kinematics variables in a modern experimental particle physics standard analysis. \n",
    "\n",
    "The three exercises in the analysis are structured as follows: \n",
    "\n",
    "  ** 1. Muon identification and isolation: ** Display different histograms for the main kinematics variables used in the muon identification and isolation. Study the different variables and establish the selection criteria.\n",
    " \n",
    "  ** 2. Candidates selection: ** Apply the selection criteria from point 1 and study the kinematic variables of the prompt muons you have selected. \n",
    " \n",
    "  ** 3. Analysis: **  After choose the most efficient selection, find out the invariant mass of opposite changed mu+ mu- pairs and identify the Z → μμ candidates. Do a statistical analysis of the results to measure the Z boson properties (Z mass and decay width).\n",
    "\n",
