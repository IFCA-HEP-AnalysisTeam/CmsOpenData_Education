    "There is already a simplified NTuple version of the original data created to perform the following exercise and named **mytree.root**. It coints the minimum information to work with. If you need to include more information you can create your own NTuple by following the instructions under [Part0: create your own NTuple from the CMS Open Data.](https://cmsopendata.ifca.es/jupyter/notebooks/tutorials/Part0.V2.ipynb).\n",

    "  \n",
    "   * We store in a local variable all the information available for each muon: the momentum (pt, px, ..), geometrical coordinates (eta, phi) and all the variables needed for the identification and isolation.\n",
    "\n",
    "   * We create different **histograms** in ROOT format [TH1F](https://root.cern.ch/doc/master/classTH1F.html) for all the variables associated to each muon and that can be shown as a **plot**.\n",
    "\n",
    "   * We can also compute new observables, like the invariant mass of two muons, and also plot it.\n",
    "   \n",
